# # Project idea for The Data Incubator: Sustainable recipe recommender
# 
# Created on Sun May  3 18:36:40 2020

# @author: sbuergers@gmail.com

# The majority of people on this planet are concerned with its future and the possibly catastrophic effects of global warming in both humanitarian and economic terms. While many people believe that eating food that is produced locally lowers their carbon footprint, research have shown that green house gas emissions due to food transport have very little overall impact.  
# 
# To assist people in shopping sustainably while at the same time cooking delicious food, I want to build a recipe recommendation engine that leverages publicly available ingredient lists for many recipes, and scientific findings on associated green house gas emissions. The goal is to suggest alternative recipes that are in line with users' tastes, but have a reduced carbon footprint to make for an easy change of cooking habits.  
# 
# As a proof of concept I have used a ~20000 recipe dataset from Kaggle and used the GetOldTweets3 API to simulate Users and their recipe preferences simply by checking if they tweeted about them. The majority of recipes could be assigned green house gas emission values and after searching for <4000 recipes I could obtain 207 user accounts from twitter after a simple first search. 
#   
# Hence, I believe that this project is feasible and more importantly interesting for a large group of people who care to change their cooking behaviour to be more sustainable without sacrificing food enjoyment.

# ### Explore relationship between number of ingredients and GHG emissions

# In[7]:


## There appear to be three clusters of Low, intermediate and high GHG output.
## Does this have to do with the number of overall ingredients? 
sns.distplot(df_rec['Number of ingredients'].dropna())

## Clearly not! Another way of looking at this:
df = df_rec.loc[:,['GHG emissions', 'Number of ingredients']].dropna()
sns.pairplot(df);
plt.suptitle('Relationship between total GHG emissions and # of ingredients');

## Surprisingly there does not seem to be much of a relationship between 
## number of ingredients and total GHG emissions, to quantify let's also do
## some statistics
import scipy
rho = scipy.stats.spearmanr(df['Number of ingredients'], df['GHG emissions'])
rho

# So statistically there definitely is a relationship, but its effect size is
# surprisingly small (Rho = 0.095)


## This relationship should be more pronounced when I consider the number
## of ingredients with an emission value
df = df_rec.loc[:,['GHG emissions', 'Num_ingr_w_GHG_data']].dropna()
sns.pairplot(df);
plt.suptitle('GHG emissions vs # of ingredients with GHG data');
rho2 = scipy.stats.spearmanr(df['Num_ingr_w_GHG_data'], df['GHG emissions'])
rho2

## As expected, this gives a much larger correlation (rho=0.48)
## Hence, there is definitely a strong incentive to make sure that most 
## ingredients can be assigned a GHG emission value, otherwise results will be
## biased.

# ## Collaborative filtering recommender

# In collaborative filtering we assign recommendations based on other users that are similar to us. For example, when James like recipes A and B and Jane like recipes A, B and C, we might consider recommending recipe C to James. 
# 
# From https://realpython.com/build-recommendation-engine-collaborative-filtering/:
# 
# User-based: For a user U, with a set of similar users determined based on rating vectors consisting of given item ratings, the rating for an item I, which hasn’t been rated, is found by picking out N users from the similarity list who have rated the item I and calculating the rating based on these N ratings.
# 
# Item-based: For an item I, with a set of similar items determined based on rating vectors consisting of received user ratings, the rating by a user U, who hasn’t rated it, is found by picking out N items from the similarity list that have been rated by U and calculating the rating based on these N ratings.
